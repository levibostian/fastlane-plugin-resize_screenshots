[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-resize_screenshots)

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-resize_screenshots`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin resize_screenshots
```

## About resize_screenshots

I love using [fastlane frameit]() to create screenshots for my iOS apps for the App Store. It's a handy tool to take screenshots I save from an iOS simulator and put them into an iPhone frame to publish to the App Store. It's a great tool that you should really check out.

However, frameit requires your screenshots to be in this very specific image size in order to put them into a frame. If your screenshot is not in that *exact* image size, it will throw an error.

When I take a screenshot in my iOS simulator, it seems to save those screenshots in `836x1811` size for iPhone X, but frameit requires `1125x2436` for iPhone X. This is super weird because the height/width ratio for `836x1811` and `1125x2436` is off by *1 pixel*. If I try to resize `836x1811` to `1125x____` with the same aspect ratio, I get `1125x2437`. Weird, right?!

Anyway, I digress.

I decided to make this plugin so I can take screenshots from my simulator, put those into a folder, resize the images automatically by device and then run those resized images into frameit for me. ðŸŽŠ No more frameit image size issues! ðŸŽŠ
